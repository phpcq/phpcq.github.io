# Plugins

Given that `phpcq` is merely a wrapper for tool running and output aggregation, it depends on plugins to run said tools
and collect their respective output.

We officially provide an ever-growing list of plugins, but you can also [write your own](developing.md).

!!! info
    If you have written a plugin that you feel should be included in this list, please do not hesitate to file a pull
    request for inclusion.

    See the [developing](developing.md) chapter for details
